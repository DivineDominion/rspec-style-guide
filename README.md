# The RSpec Style Guide

This RSpec style guide recommends best practices so that real-world Ruby
programmers can write code that can be maintained by other real-world Ruby
programmers. A style guide that reflects real-world usage gets used, and a
style guide that holds to an ideal that has been rejected by the people it is
supposed to help risks not getting used at all &ndash; no matter how good it is.

The guide is separated into several sections of related rules. I've
tried to add the rationale behind the rules (if it's omitted I've
assumed that is pretty obvious).

The guide is still a work in progress - some rules are lacking
examples, some rules don't have examples that illustrate them clearly
enough. In due time these issues will be addressed - just keep them in
mind for now.

## Source Code Layout

* Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding.
* Use two **spaces** per indentation level.

    ```Ruby
    # good
    def some_method
      do_something
    end

    # bad - four spaces
    def some_method
        do_something
    end
    ```

# Spread the Word

A community-driven style guide is of little use to a community that
doesn't know about its existence. Tweet about the guide, share it with
your friends and colleagues. Every comment, suggestion or opinion we
get makes the guide just a little bit better. And we want to have the
best possible guide, don't we?
